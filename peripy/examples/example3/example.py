"""
A simple, 3D perdiynamics simulation example.

This example is compared to real life experimental data from GrÃ©goire et al.
[1], and also verified against Mark Hobbs peridynamics code's [2] simulation
data, which was developed independently from PeriPy.

This example is a 0.175m x 0.05m x 0.05m plain concrete, simply supported
beam with no pre-crack, subjected to displacement controlled three-point
bending. The displacement loading follows a 5th order polynomial so that
acceleration of the boundaries is zero at the start and end of the simulation.
The span between the supports is 0.125m. The model uses a ``trilinear"
constitutive model. No surface correction factors or partial volume correction
factors are applied to the model.

In this example, the first time the volume, family and connectivity of the
model are calculated, they are also stored in file `175beam3620.h5'.
In subsequent simulations, the arrays are loaded from this h5 file instead of
being calculated again, therefore reducing the overhead of initiating the
model.

The output is a load-CMOD curve which is compared to the experimental data [1]
and to the verification data [2].
